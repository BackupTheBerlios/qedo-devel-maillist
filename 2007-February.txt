The Middleware conference is a forum for the discussion of important
innovations and recent advances in the design and construction of  
middleware.
Middleware is distributed-systems software that resides between the
applications and the underlying operating systems, network protocol  
stacks,
and hardware. Its primary role is to functionally bridge the gap between
application programs and the lower-level hardware and software  
infrastructure
in order to coordinate how application components are connected and  
how they
interoperate.

Following the success of past conferences in this series, the 8th
International Middleware Conference will be the premier event for  
middleware
research and technology in 2007. The scope of the conference is the  
design,
implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed system  
platforms and
architectures for future computing and communication environments.  
Highlights
of the conference will include a high quality technical program, invited
speakers, poster and demo presentations, a doctoral symposium, and  
workshops.

Submissions on a diversity of topics are sought, particularly ones that
identify new research directions. Middleware 2007 is not limited to  
topics
discussed in previous Middleware conferences. Authors concerned about  
the
appropriateness of a topic may communicate by electronic mail with  
the program
chairs prior to submission. The proceedings of Middleware 2007 will be
published as a Springer-Verlag volume in the Lecture Notes in  
Computer Science
Series.


Topics
------

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

Platforms and Architectures:
* Middleware for Web services and Web-service composition
* Middleware for cluster and grid computing
* Peer-to-peer middleware solutions
* Event-based, publish/subscribe, and message-oriented middleware
* Communication protocols and architectures
* Middleware for ubiquitous and mobile computing
* Middleware for embedded systems and sensor networks
* Service-oriented architectures
* Reconfigurable, adaptable, and reflective middleware approaches

Systems issues:
* Reliability, fault tolerance, and quality-of-service in general
* Scalability of middleware: replication and caching
* Systems management, including solutions for autonomic and self- 
managing
    middleware
* Middleware feedback control solutions for self-regulation
* Real-time solutions for middleware platforms
* Information assurance and security
* Evaluation techniques for middleware solutions
* Middleware support for multimedia streaming
* Middleware solutions for (large scale) distributed databases

Design principles and tools:
* Formal methods and tools for designing, verifying, and evaluating
    middleware
* Model-driven architectures
* Software engineering for middleware
* Engineering principles and approaches for middleware
* Novel development paradigms, APIs, and languages
* Existing paradigms revisited: object models, aspect orientation, etc.
* On-the-fly management and configuration of middleware
