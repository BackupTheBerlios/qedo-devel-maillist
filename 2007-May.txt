Subject: [Qedo-devel] QoSEnabler
Message-ID: <545382.85944.qm@web33614.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello!

I would like to use the QoSEnabler as a monitor in the
container. To monitor outside events and communicate
with the other components via QoSUsage or callbacks.

The QoSEnabler supports a "getSystemLoad" interface. 

This is how I install the enabler as a service:
context_->install_service_reference("QoSMonitor",
component_);

And this is how I call it from the component:
 - I include QoSEnabler_component_EQUIVALENT.h and do:

CORBA::Object_var qosmonitor =
context_->resolve_service_reference("QoSMonitor");
			QoSEnabler::SystemLoadMonitor_var monitor =
QoSEnabler::SystemLoadMonitor::_narrow(qosmonitor);

double system_load = monitor->getSystemLoad();


It compiles ok but the method call from the component
fails somehow...

Also, I would like to know I could use the callback
way to interact with the component from the
QoSEnabler.

Thank you!
